		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
		
		<h3> <a href="https://arngren.net">arngren.net</a></h3>
		
		<p>
		    arngren.net appears to be some kind of Norwegian website for selling recreational vehicles such as Jeeps and toy cars for children. It's certainly one of the most poorly designed websites I've ever seen. Here is my analysis of arngren.net according to the CRAP principles:
		    <ul>
		        <li>Contrast: Many of the various labels and links on this site violate the contrast principle by overlaying bright colors on top of bright backgrounds. The links seem to alternate from bright green to bright red and blue. With the links being bunched together as they are, it makes it very uncomfortable to read. There is also little distinction in the font sizes of the labels, which makes it hard to discern the organization of the text. 
		        </li>
		        <li>Repetition: The layout of the site is extremely inconsistent. The font sizes will jump erratically from big to small and then back to big again seemingly without reason or purpose. Although there are borders around certain objects, the border width differs from item to item, again without any apparent reason. </li>
		        <li>Alignment: This is perhaps the most egregiously violated principle of all. Pictures of the site's many vehicles are strewn about haphazardly in an unorganized fashion. It looks like a collage of photos, which might be good for a scrapbook, but makes for a poor shopping experience for the user. Occasionally pictures will even overlap some of the menu items on the left. It just looks very messy and poorly thought out.</li>
		        <li>Proximity: This is the least offensive violation, in that pricing information and the names of items are located near their respective pictures, making it easy to discern the item to which they refer. Borders are also used to group information in areas where it might become jumbled. That's not to say that it is perfect by any means. The lack of consistent organization inevitably means that text is placed in such a way that it is not immediately clear what the relationships are. </li>
		    </ul>
		    Conclusion: arngren.net almost completely ignores every principle of good web design. I can't imagine that the average user will want to use this site over other, cleaner websites.

		<h3> <a href="https://www.amazon.com/?tag=admarketus-20&ref=pd_sl_aE7083A6CE591A79DE71F87508">amazon.com</a></h3>
		
		<p> Amazon is one of the most popular online retailers in the world. This site allows users to purchase just about anything, from groceries to consumer electronics. Amazon's competitive edge relies on its website being user-friendly for people from all walks of life. Here is how it stacks up against the CRAP principles:
		    
		    <ul>
		        <li>
		            Contrast: Amazon uses a simple white background with black text and pictures for its overall layout style. Everything is easy to read and plenty of whitespace is used to separate images and text. The many buttons throughout the website use brown text against yellow/orange backgrounds, which are also quite easy to read.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            Repetition: On the home page, white boxes of uniform width and height are used to group items together by category. The item images themselves are also usually the same resolution as one another. The links at the top of the page use the same font and size. Overall everything is synchronized quite well.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            Alignment: Alignment is strictly observed throughout Amazon.com, with its many boxes and links perfectly aligned with one another. Equal amounts of white space are used to separate elements.
		        </li>
		        <li>
		            Proximity: Text is placed in such a way that it is easy to understand to what item it is referring to. There is rarely any confusion as to what the relationships amongst the many elements are. 
		        </li>
		    </ul>
		    Conclusion: Amazon makes good use of CRAP principles to create a site that is both aesthetically pleasing as well as user-friendly.
