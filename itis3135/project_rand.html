		<h3>Quote Farm</h3>
		<h3>Matthew Wieser</h3>
		<h3>10/17/2021</h3>
		<h3>Project Name: Quote Farm</h3>
		<h3>Project Overview: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>This is a website that generates famous quotes based on certain
				criteria. For example, a user might wish to generate a quote randomly.
				Other times a user might want to pull a list of quotes by a particular
				historical figure or by the nature of the quote (uplifting, funny, etc...). This
				is pretty similar to the site azquotes.com, but I think that I can improve it in some
				ways and make it more enjoyable for the user.
			</li>
			<li>The intended user for this website is someone that enjoys reading
				and sharing interesting quotes from a wide range of modern and historical figures.
				Another type of user might be a student or journalist looking for quotes to back
				up his or her argument.
			</li>
			<li>The content of this website will consist of pages that direct
			the user to search for quotes randomly, by content-type, or by a
			particular author. It will likely have to search an internet database
			for the quotes. Each quote should contain the quote, who it's attributed
			to, and a picture of the person who said the quote, if available.</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Client Information: </h3>
		<ul>
			<li>The name of my client is Kimberly Ryan, my mother.</li>
			<li>Kim Ryan is a bank teller at Bank of the Ozarks</li>
			<li>Email: childofthe7nties@aol.com</li>
			<li>Phone number: (704) 472-2014</li>
		</ul>
		<h3>Site Map: </h3>

				and links to other parts of the site.

				The audience for this page would be the users. This is where the
				users will land when they first visit the site.

				that changes each time the page is visited, a brief explanation of
				the site, and links to other areas of the site.

		<h3>Page Design: About Us</h3>

				Contains information about myself, my fake company, and the inspiration for the website, as well
				as a more in-depth explanation of how the site works.
			</li>
			<li>
				The audience for this page is someone who is looking for more information
				about the creator of the site as well as the company that made the site.
			</li>
			<li>
				Contains an explanation of the companies values, the main designer of the
				site, and more detailed information on how the site works.
			</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Page Design: Company Page</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Page Name: ManiacRazorbackWombat LLC</li>

			</li>
			<li>

		<h3>Page Design: Author Bio</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Page Name: Author Bio</li>
			<li>Contains a description of the author's life and accomplishments. This can be
			accessed either by clicking on the author's name or by clicking on his or her image
			next to a quote. This will likely just contain snippets of information from Wikipedia. For
			example, I might simply extract the intro paragraph from Wikipedia and use that. This might simply
			be a link that automatically searches for the accompanying Wikipedia article.</li>
			<li>
				Audience is users who want to dig deeper into a historical figure's life.
			</li>
			<li>
				A list of authors organized alphabetically from A-Z with links to the corresponding Wikipedia articles
				on their lives.
